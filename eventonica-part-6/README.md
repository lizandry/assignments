Hello, volunteer!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.

I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall Postgres after a few hours of working on my project. And now I can't figure out how to create a table from the command line again. So this submission is sparse. Was working on some pg-promise code before the reboot, am not sure if it would work yet, on account of I am still unable to test it. It's in index.js and EventRecommender.js (under EventRecommender.addUser(params)).

Thank you, again, and I hope you have a wonderful week!
