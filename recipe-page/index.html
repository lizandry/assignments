        <h2>pasta alla checca</h2>

        <p>Now this is the good stuff right here! A good pasta friend to whip up basically whenever. I first encountered Pasta Alla Checca in Rome, 2016. The album of the trip was the reissue of Say Anything's "...Is a Real Boy". Italy's trending music videos
            were Finley's "Dentro Alla Scatola", Tiziano Ferro's "Stop! Dimentia" and Nerina Pallot's "Everybody's Gone To War". My cousin Laura prepared this simple dish as our two families sat in front of the TV, watching reports of an attempted plane
            bombing in England that would keep us American visitors in her home a day or two longer than expected. Earlier, my sister and I watched an Italian-dubbed episode of the American television show "Atlantis", making up funny things for the characters
            to say.
            <br>
            <br>A few weeks earlier, we had been among the last batch of travelers allowed to carry more than 3oz of liquid on an airplane. In a few days, my other sister would sit on a chocolate pudding cup during a flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas,
            then have a spontaneous nosebleed that led to her, at 10 years old and in the wake of a terror plot, walking through US customs covered in blood and what appeared to be human feces. But at the time, that pasta whipped. The best I'd ever had,
            tomatoes straight from my cousins' garden. It's a dish I've since put my own stink on: the kind of meal you can make a party out of as long as you start from the right base: garlic, olive oil and some CHOICE tomatoes.
            <br>
            <br>It's not only something you can prepare in a pinch, but something cravable. I'll often make it when I'm feeling stressed out, finding a meditative comfort in slicing and dicing a frankly unconscionable amount of garlic. It's a recipe I'd
            like to share with friends. Did you know the name roughly translates to "Pasta for Gay Men"? I didn't, until I googled it to check my spelling for this project! It brought big a smile to my trans-masculine face. Yes, this is truly the pasta
            of my people. So without further ado, here's my spin on Pasta Alla Checca.

        <h4>instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the tomatoes into bite-sized pieces. Pro tip: a bread knife will really help in this task. The correct volume of tomatoes to use is "whatever amount I think would pair well with a bulb or two of garlic." These can pretty much be any style
                of tomato you please! Hothouse, cherry, heirloom. The important part is that you smell them before bringing them home, and they smell like something you'd really like to put in your mouth. No wet styrofoam allowed in this dish! Even canned
                tomatoes will do in a pinch, as they're canned at the peak of ripeness. Though if you're using canned, you'll want to cook them into the sauce rather than serving them up raw.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If using fresh tomatoes, salt those bad boys and let them sit! Salting early will allow time for your tomatoes to become imbued with flavor, through osmosis.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Chunk up that garlic!! Anything from toothsome hunks to paper-thin slicing to a fine mince. Crushed is not recommended here, unless you're doing the entire sauce raw. In which case, please reduce the amount of garlic CONSIDERABLY or you will
                harm yourself and your loved ones. And please... don't use garlic that comes out of a jar. It has its uses, this is NOT one of them.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you want a raw sauce, throw your clove or two of crushed garlic together with the tomatoes, a reasonable glug of olive oil, whatever optional toppings you want, and dip out of this recipe now! This is, legally speaking, the original recipe
                and your work is done. Pull up some pasta, and buon appetito</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you're here for *the good stuff*, pop that garlic into a relatively-wide stovetop pan, along with a BIG OL GLUG of olive oil. It should look like just a little more oil than you're comfortable with. A nice flavor is important because you're
                going to be able to taste it in the sauce. Nothing too fancy is important because it's going to be overshadowed by the garlic and tomatoes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Set the temperature around medium-high if you want this to go fast, then knock it down to low once the oil seems relatively warm.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Be mindful of the size of your garlic bits! A fine mince will cook (and also burn) more quickly than chonky boys, but too high a temperature may cause bigger bites to burn before they're cooked through. Low and slow, pay attention, it's finished
                when your kitchen smells nicely of garlic and when you fish out a piece and bite it you think "yeah, I could eat a bowl of this."</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add in the tomatoes! You can pull the pan off the stove immediately for an al dente tomato experience, or you can let them cook along with the sauce for a few minutes, softening them up.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have a garlic... affinity. At this point, I usually think to myself "this is good, but I'd like a little more of a fresh garlic spike to it". Enter: a clove of freshly-crushed garlic, stirred in well. Or a little secret ingredient I like
                to use: the lebanese garlic sauce known as "toum". It's basically just a load of raw garlic whipped into oil, until it takes on an opaque color and creamy, fluffy texture. Luckily, you don't have to seek out a lebanese restaurant or make
                this sauce yourself, my good friend trader joe whipped some up and sells it near the hummus, under the name "garlic sauce". The creaminess adds a je ne sais quoi to this dish, and really sends it to another level.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When your sauce is fully ready to be off the stove, throw in some basil prepared to the texture you want it at. If you forgot fresh basil, but have some dried stuff, go back in time to step 2 and throw it onto the tomatoes along with the salt.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>It's time to throw this over some pasta! Truly any shape is fine, though angel hair is decidedly the best. Farfalle is also great, especially if you're adding in a lot of fresh mozzarella. The thought of using, say, a fettuccine makes me feel
                physically ill. But just because I'm not a pervert myself, it doesn't mean you're not allowed to be one. This recipe belongs to you now!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Toppings: cubes of fresh mozzarella about the size of the tomato chunks? A+, perfect dish. Black pepper? Sure, let's go! Cut up bits of prosciutto? Elegant, decadent! Those purple little olives? Haven't tried it, but it could be good! I saw
                a recipe with pine nuts on top, and I'm absolutely craving some of those toasty boys right now. Let the possibilities of your creation be limited only by reason.</li>
