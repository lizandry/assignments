You need to build a program that lets users browse a list of events and save the ones they are interested in. 
For today's piece of the project, you'll write object-oriented JS code to manage users and events. 
In a later lesson, you'll add a UI for your users to use.

When you instantiate an EventRecommender object, you should be able to do the following:

Users:
-Add a new User to the System
-Allow users to save events to a personal Events array
-Delete a User from the System
Event:
-Add a new Event to the System
-Delete an Event from the System
Search:
-Search for events by date
-Search for events by category

Before you start coding, think about and write down the answers to these questions:

What classes will you create?

What properties should each class have? Think about: What properties are needed to complete the assignment? 
What other properties would be helpful to include as well?

What methods should each class have?

class Event
properties: title, main performer, date, category, venue, 
description, doorTime, showTime,
methods: addEvent, 

Event subclasses
concerts: primary performers, secondary performers
sports: opponants
festivals: open AND close, date range, 
arts & theatre: 
family: 

class or event subclass venue
 seating, accessibility, parking, zip code,
 methods: 

class User
properties: chosenName, firstName, address, lastName, zipcode, disabilities,
conditions(ie has kids, weekends and weeknights only, etc)
(legal name and address only for security/confirmation reasons ie billing, 21+ shows)
methods: changeName, addAddress, addZipCode, (general privacy stuff),
addVenuePreferences(disabilities and conditions, categories enjoyed)

class EventRecommender
properties: dates, attendees, 
methods: compareLocations, checkVenuePreferences, dateSelector, attendeeSelector
