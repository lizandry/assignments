This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## important locations:
* database: ./dbexport.pgsql
* react server: ./index http://localhost:3001/
* express server: ../animal-tracker-express/server.js http://localhost:3005/

## works: 
* connects to database http://localhost:3001/sightings
* submission form 

## works in progress:
* the submission form doesn't have a place to identify the specific animal. was gonna add one in after other problems were sorted
* couldn't get the syntax correct on the POST request connected to submission form. it's close, there's almost certainly one minor error between creating the json and parsing it
* the list component is so close to being complete. and i'm certain the second i submit this project, i'm gonna remember EXACTLY how to map an array into jsx
