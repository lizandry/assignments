const letters = Array.fromCharCode(65 + 90);
//this is nothing, i tried to bind an array of letters by using unicode references
//the idea now is to make an array that can be iterated over to give the characters value
//might also have to look into the math behind boggle, and do a math thing representing the proportions of each letter
//within the boggle board.
//YIKES. reading into it now

//i'm back. helpful link for myself: https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/29264/boggle-what-is-the-dice-configuration-for-boggle-in-various-languages
//yeah, i'm just gonna make a "dice" component and let it get real ugly in there
const boggleEmUp = boggleEmUp() => {
    let
    //this one's gonna be the thing that happens when you shake up the boggle
}

const areTheyTouching = areTheyTouching() => {
    //this one's going to figure out how far the tiles are from each other, to see if the rules check out
