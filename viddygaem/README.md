# Liz's Excellent Game of Boggle

i made a little boggle app! it's pretty, it's responsive, it has ONE very neat function running under the hood for now. but i'll hopefully get a second one in tonight. and who knows, maybe a third one over the weekend!

## Getting Started

* when you open the page, it should load right up for you. the boggling button is a little inconspicuous, but it's the invisible thing that says "boggle it, babyy!!!!" on it.
* some letters are going to appear in the dice, and the button itself will disappear. this is because resetting the array i used, allowing the contents of the dice to be refreshed without reloading the page, seemed like a lot of work and i still have another function to write.
* i'll hopefully figure out something fun to do with the letters before this project is due, and also learn how boggle is played.
* for now, just have fun reloading and resizing this very responsive application!!!
